Spotifast is a Spotify client written in Rust with
[egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It plays music through
[librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), typically uses
100–250 MB of RAM, starts in well under a second, and has no browser engine.

**Playback needs Spotify Premium.** Free accounts can browse and search, but
cannot play music through Spotifast.

## Your music, on your desktop

| Feature | What you can do |
|---|---|
| **Library and search** | Browse playlists, Liked Songs, albums, artists, and podcasts. Retry interrupted playlist loading without restarting. Search the catalogue and edit playlists you own. |
| **Spotify Connect** | Play on this computer or control playback on your other devices. |
| **Themes** | Choose light, dark, system appearance, or custom colours. On Omarchy, follow your desktop theme. |
| **Desktop controls** | Use keyboard shortcuts and media keys. Keep music playing from the tray when supported by your desktop and settings. |
| **Winamp mini player** | Use classic skins with an equalizer, playlist, and animated sound displays. |
| **MilkDrop** | Watch music-reactive visuals in a separate window or full screen. See platform availability below. |

## Install

| Platform | Installation |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `brew install --cask crmne/tap/spotifast`, or [download the Mac app](https://spotifast.rocks/download/#macos). |
| **Arch Linux** | `yay -S spotifast-bin` |
| **Windows** | Choose your build on the [Download page](https://spotifast.rocks/download/). |
| **Other Linux** | Find Flatpak, AppImage, Nix, and other options on the [Download page](https://spotifast.rocks/download/). |
| **From source** | Follow [Build from source](https://spotifast.rocks/getting-started/#build-from-source) for dependencies and commands. |

## Start listening

1. Open Spotifast and choose **Sign in with Spotify**. Approve access in your
   browser, then return to the app to see your library.
2. To listen on this computer, open the device menu in the bottom player bar
   and choose **Set up playback here**, also available in Settings.
3. Complete the separate playback approval in your browser. Your computer
   appears as a Spotify Connect device named **Spotifast**.

Library access and local playback have separate approvals. Spotifast remembers
both using your computer's protected storage. See
[Getting started](https://spotifast.rocks/getting-started/) for the full walkthrough
and [How it connects](https://spotifast.rocks/how-it-connects/) for the details.

## The Winamp mini player

A classic look for your music, with Winamp 2 `.wsz` skins, an equalizer,
a playlist, and animated sound displays. Switch with **Ctrl+M**
(**Cmd+Shift+M** on macOS), the shrink button, or Settings.

[Explore the mini player](https://spotifast.rocks/winamp/), including skins,
window sizes, controls, and the return to the main player.

## Music in motion

MilkDrop reacts to music playing on this computer, with more than 10,000
presets downloaded on first use. Open it from the visualiser button,
Settings, or the mini player's **V** menu.

![MilkDrop visualiser displaying coloured concentric patterns in Spotifast](docs/assets/images/milkdrop-poster.jpg)

Included on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows Intel/AMD** builds.
It is not included in the Windows on ARM download.
[Read the MilkDrop guide](https://spotifast.rocks/milkdrop/) for presets,
controls, and fullscreen mode.
